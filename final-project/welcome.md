# Data Structure Tutorial

> "If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."
> â€• Edsger Dijkstra[^1]
> Welcome!

In this tutorial, I will cover three data structures: Stacks[^2], Linked Lists[^3], and Trees[^4]. For each data structure, I will discuss when it is used, its time complexity and show an example of how to use it. Each module will also include a problem to practice your newly learned skills!

If this is your first time reading about data structures then do not fear. A data structure is simply a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently[^4]. While this tutorial covers only three data structures, there are many more[^6]. Enjoy!
