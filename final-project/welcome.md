# Data Structure Tutorial
In this tutorial I will cover three data structures: Stacks[^1], Linked Lists[^2], and Trees[^3]. For each data structure, I will discuss when it is used, it's time complexity and show an example of how to use it. Each module will also include a problem to practice your newly learned skills!

If this is your first time reading about data structures then do not fear. A data structure is simply a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently[^4]. This tutorial will only cover 3 common data structures that you will encounter as a softare developer.
